            <p>Looking to adopt a Samoy puppy/dog? Puppies and dogs are available! Looking for active owners who are willing to devote their 
                time into raising them with unconditional love. They are also trained ready to enter competitions so they are defiantly in need 
                of a playful and active owner who will take them on lots of walk, treat them well and even once in a while spoil them with treats for 
                their efforts. Our center doesn't allow just anyone to take them home and we will carefully screen and select owners who have proper knowledge 
                about animals and can show us they are the right fit for these pooches! Contact us now if you are interested in owning a Samoy today!
